EDA and Visualisation on Cardiovascular Disease in India Dataset.
================================================================

- Web reference: http://visualising.org/datasets/cardiovascular-disease-india
- Dataset Source : http://visualising.org/sites/default/files/data_set/edward_lee/india_chd_data.xlsx

The First Challenge I face is that the data is not formatted with any standard. So I have to do some data munging and remove many redundant rows and variables.


Possible sources of more data from Indian Goverment Data portal.

##Deaths Analysis:

###Questions to be asked:
1) Which disease is the major cause of deaths in India?
2) What is the correlation with each disease and age groups?
3) What is the relationship of the death of genders with the diseases?
