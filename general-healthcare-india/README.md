Healthcare in India
===========================
----------------------------

Introduction
------------

The healthcare system in India is made up of a mammoth network of Health Sub-centre (SCs), Community Health Centre(CHCs), Primary Health Centres (PHCs) spread across the country. These health centre work in tandem with each other to provide necessary healthcare facilities to their respective state citizens. 

There are several questions that we wished to explore in our quest to understand the state of healthcare in India and subsequent efforts put forth by the state governments.

----------------------------------------------

Contribution
------------
We perform exploratory data analysis on the data provided by [Open Data], an initiative of  Government of India. 

In this part of data analysis we analyse the efforts made by respective governments and restrospect their abysmal or appreciable performance. 

--------------------------------------------

Data Source
------------

We undertake this exploration to explore following to dataset. All the analysis done by us is statewise.

* [Shortfall in Health Infrastructure during Eleventh Plan]
* [Infant Mortality Rates in 2011]
* [Shortfall in Manpower in the Phcs and Chcs]

--------------------------------------------------------


Exploration
-----------
(questions which we wish to explore from the data)

We combine the above mentioned datasets to analyse the efforts made by the government depending upon the situation of the healthcare requirements of that particular state.

There are several questions which we wish to contemplate from the data.
* Whether the efforts made by the respective state government are in alignment with the current scenario of healthcare in their state.
* Which state lacks in the necessary healthcare centres the most, viz-a-viz ,Health Sub-centres (SCs) Community Health Centre(CHCs), Primary Health Centres (PHCs)
* Are the state governments under-investing on basic healthcare issues 
* How have the State governments to the shortfalls in the number of health centres from their 11<sup>th</sup> plan to 12<sup>th</sup> plan.
