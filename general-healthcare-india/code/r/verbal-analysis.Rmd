Shortfall in Health Infrastructure vs GOvernment Funding
========================================================

This is a document showing some results we found by doing EDA(Explorartory Data Analysis) on healthcare datasets from data.gov.in. 

The analysis.R script does some data wrangling and create a table with shortfall, government effort and surplus or shortfall between the two.
```{r}
require(ggplot2)
require(dplyr)
source("analysis.R")
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=4}
qplot(x=sc_shortfall, data=analysis_data, binwidth=50) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(-2000,15000))
```

This shows us that in the sub centre infrastrucure. Two states are the real outliers. Lets find out which ones are they. 

```{r}
analysis_data %.%
  filter(sc_shortfall > 5000) %.%
  select( state_and_ut)
```
