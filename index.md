<p>This is a repository for all the exploratory analysis and data analysis projects. These projects have been fun. They have been accomplished in a day or a couple of hours not more, staying true  to the spirit of exploratory analysis.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare-infrastructure-eda">Healthcare Infrastructure EDA</h2>

<p>This project is an exploration of 2 data sets from excellent data initiative of the Indian government. The website is an year old website which made many data sets available publicly. Our first data set contains the requirements for healthcare infrastructure in each state and union territory of India. These requirements are based on the rural population estimates in Census 2011. The analysis shows that 

<ul>
<li>Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal are the states that really lack infrastructure at all levels.</li>
<li>Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka have surplus in healthcare Infrastructure.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="course-exploratory-data-analysis">Course: Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>

<p>This is a course on <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">coursera</a> which teaches the techniques to summarize the data and do some preliminary analysis to make sense of what are the important aspects in the data and what variables are useless. In this course I build upon the following skill set</p>

<ul>
<li>Quickly Plotting exploratory graphs for 1, 2 and multi-dimension features</li>
<li>Principles behind exploratory analyses.</li>
<li>Clustering using simple distance matrix.</li>
<li>Dimension Reduction Techniques.</li>
</ul>

<p>My complete notes on the course are <a href="https://github.com/nehiljain/data-analysis-projects/blob/gh-pages/eda-coursera/notes.md">here</a>. Unfortunately, I started the course after the deadline of the 1st Assignment had past. So I directly attempted the course project 2. <a href="http://nehiljain.github.io/data-analysis-projects/eda-coursera/index.html">Here</a> is my solution. I used ggplot to plot graphs to answer the questions asked from the Air Pollution Data set. This data set is richer than the healthcare infrastructure data i worked on previously. </p>
